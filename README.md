Data products in data science specialisation

This repository is my work on an assignment for a data science specialisation done on Coursera with the John Hopkins University.

The goal of this submit is to make a simple shiny app working on web. This application is completed by a slidify presentation.

My application is based on a simple algorithm, BMI calculation.

It compares your weigth and height and give you a BMI result, which is comparable of a table given, which tell you if you're normal weigth, over or under weigth.
This is a basic approach, not taking part of other settings like ages, people doing sport or other kind of things that migth affect the nature of overweigth.
